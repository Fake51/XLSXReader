Introduction
============
This is a small one file library for reading .xlsx files in PHP.
The main reason for creating this was finding PHPExcel and not
being able to use it (memory constraints).

Usage
=====
<?php

require xlsxreader.php;
$reader = new XLSXReader($zip_file_name);
$sheets = $reader->getSheets();

foreach ($sheets as $sheet) {
    foreach ($sheet->getRowIterator() as $row_index => $row) {
        foreach ($row->getCellIterator() as $cell_index => $cell) {
            // do stuff
        }
    }
}
